# online-offline-budget-tracker

This Progressive Web App, using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, IndexedDB, cache API, and Service Workers, affords the user both online and offline functionality, as well as functionality in both the browser and as a mobile app. The user can keep track of a budget by recording transactions. Because this app uses IndexedDB, any transaction made offline will be automatically updated when the user goes back online.
